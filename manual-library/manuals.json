This temperature threshold ensures proper ice formation before initiating the defrost cycle.\n\nDefrost Timer Operation:\n- Timer activates when evaporator outlet temperature reaches 48°F\n- Defrost cycle duration: 3-5 minutes\n- Hot gas valve opens during defrost cycle\n- Water pump operates to remove melted ice\n- Timer resets after defrost cycle completion\n\nPage 15 - Troubleshooting Defrost Issues\n\nIf defrost timer fails to start:\n1. Check evaporator outlet temperature sensor\n2. Verify thermostat calibration (should trigger at 48°F)\n3. Test timer motor operation\n4. Check control board defrost relay\n\nPage 20 - Electrical Specifications\n\nDefrost Timer Specifications:\n- Voltage: 24V AC\n- Current: 0.5A\n- Temperature sensor: NTC thermistor\n- Activation temperature: 48°F ±2°F\n- Timer motor: Synchronous, 1 RPM\n\nPage 25 - Maintenance Procedures\n\nMonthly defrost system check:\n1. Verify 48°F activation temperature\n2. Test timer motor operation\n3. Clean evaporator coils\n4. Check hot gas valve operation\n5. Inspect water drain system",
