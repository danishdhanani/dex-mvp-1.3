Service Diagnosis\n WARNING\n• The appliance should be diagnosed and repaired only by qualified service \npersonnel to reduce the risk of death, electric shock, serious injury, or fire.\n• Risk of electric shock. Control switch in \"OFF\" position does not de\n-\nenergize all \nloads Use extreme caution and exercise safe electrical practices.\n• Moving parts (e.g., fan blade) can crush and cut. Keep hands clear.\n• Before servicing the appliance, move the control switch to the \"OFF\" position and \nturn off the power supply. \n• \nCHOKING HAZARD:\n Ensure all components, fasteners, and thumbscrews are \nsecurely in place after the appliance is serviced. Make sure that none have fallen \ninto the dispenser unit/ice storage bin.\n• Make sure all food zones in the appliance and dispenser unit/ice storage bin are \nclean after service. \nThe diagnostic procedure is a sequence check that allows you to diagnose the electrical \nsystem and components. Before proceeding, check for correct installation, proper voltage \nper nameplate, and adequate water supply. Check CB using the steps in \"II.C. Control \nBoard Check.\" Check dip switch settings to assure that S4 dip switch 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10 and \nS5 dip switch 1 through 5 (\"G\" CB) are in the factory default position. S4 dip switch 1, 2, \n5, 6 are cleaning adjustments and the settings are flexible. For factory default settings, \nsee \"III.C.1. Default Dip Switch Settings.\"\n \nNote: • When checking high voltage (115VAC), always choose a white (W) neutral wire to \nestablish a good neutral connection.\n• On 208-230/60/1 models with main transformer and 208-230/60/3 models, the \nappliance neutral (W) is provided through the main transformer. To confirm \na good neutral, check for 60VAC from white (W) neutral to ground (GND). \nIf 60VAC is present, neutral is good. If 60VAC is not present, check 208-230VAC \nmain power supply to main transformer. If 208-230VAC is present, check main \ntransformer continuity.\n• When checking voltage from the CB K1 connector (10 pin connector), pull \nCB K1 connector out slightly to allow room for multimeter test leads contact.\n1) Turn off the power supply, then access the control box. Move the control switch to the \n\"OFF\" position. Clear any ice from BC.  \n2) Check that the 115VAC 10A fuse is good.\n18\n1. \"E\" and \"G\" Control Board without Harvest Pump Timer Diagnosis\n3) \nPower On\n: Turn on the power supply, then move the control switch to the \"ICE\" position.\nA 5\n-\nsec. delay occurs. \n• \"E\" Control Board: CB red \"POWER OK\" LED turns on.\n• \"G\" Control Board: CB red \"POWER OK\" LED and green \"BC CLOSED\" LED turn on. \nNote: • CB red \"POWER\" LED remains on unless the 10.5VAC power supply is \ninterrupted (K2 connector).\n• Check CB using the steps in \"II.C. Control Board Check.\"\n•\n \n\"G\" CB with Thermostatic Bin Control: If yellow \"BC OPEN\" LED is on, check that \nCB red K4 connector has jumper 4A4883G01 properly connected. \n• \"G\" CB with Mechanical Bin Control: If yellow \"BC OPEN\" LED is on (indicating a \nfull bin), check MBC. See \"II.D.2. Mechanical Bin Control Check and Cleaning.\"\na) \nPower On Diagnosis:\n If CB red \"POWER OK\" LED is off, confirm closed TBC and \n10A fuse is good. If TBC is open, remove ice from bulb and warm bulb in hand. \nIf TBC does not close, replace TBC. See \"II.D.1. Thermostatic Bin Control Check.\" \nCheck for 115VAC at control switch #1 (BR) to neutral (W) then at control switch \n#2 (P) to neutral (W). If 115VAC is present on #1 (BR) and not on #2 (P), replace \ncontrol switch. If 115VAC is present on control switch #2 (P), check for 115VAC at \nHPS (P) to neutral (W) then HPS (BK) to neutral (W). If 115VAC is present at HPS \n(P) and not at HPS (BK), HPS is open. See HPS Diagnosis below. If 115VAC is \npresent at HPS (BK), check for 10.5VAC at CB K2 #1 red wire to CB K2 #2 red wire. \nIf 10.5VAC is not present, check that the cleaning valve is closed and the interlock \nswitch is closed. Next, check CT continuity. If open replace CT. \nb) \nHPS Diagnosis:\n Check that the condenser coil is not clogged or restricted. Let \nrefrigeration circuit pressures equalize. If HPS does not reset and pressures are \nequalized, replace HPS. If pressures are not equalized, reclaim refrigerant and \ndiagnose refrigeration circuit restriction. Check that there are no restrictions in the \nrefrigeration circuit. \n \nHarvest Cycle: HGV, strainer, or check valve. \n \nFreeze Cycle: FM, FMR, TXV, HM, LLV, strainer, check valve, drier, and damaged line \nset or fitting. Also confirm WRV opens in freeze cycle.\n \nConfirm that the location meets installation requirements: \n• The icemaker is not intended for outdoor use. Normal operating ambient temperature \nshould be within 45°F to 100°F (7°C to 38°C). \n• Allow 6\" (15 cm) clearance at rear, sides, and top for proper air circulation and ease \nof maintenance and/or service should they be required.\n• The appliance should not be located in a corrosive environment.\n19\n4) \n1-Minute Fill Cycle – LED 4 is on.\n WV energizes. After 1\n \nmin., CB checks for a closed \nFS. If FS is closed, harvest cycle begins. If harvest cycle begins (Comp, HGV, and FMR \nenergize), continue to step 5. If FS is open, WV remains energized through additional \n1\n-\nmin. fill cycles until water enters the water tank and FS closes (low water safety \nprotection during initial start up and at the end of each harvest). \nDiagnosis:\n Check \nthat water enters the water tank. If not, check that the water supply line shut\n-\noff valve \nis open and screens or external filters are clear. Check for 115VAC at CB K1 #6 (O) \nto neutral (W). If 115VAC is not present, replace CB. If 115VAC is present, and WV \ndoes not energize, check for 115VAC at WV. If 115VAC is present, check coil continuity. \nIf open, replace WV. If the water tank fills, but the appliance fails to start harvest (Comp \nenergized), check for open FS. See \"II.E. Float Switch Check and Cleaning.\" If FS is \nclosed and CB fails to start the harvest cycle after 1 min., replace CB.\n5) \nInitial Harvest Cycle – LEDs 1, 4, and 2 are on.\n WV continues. Comp, FMR, and \nHGV energize. CB monitors the warming of the evaporator via the thermistor located \non the suction line. When the thermistor reaches 48°F (9°C), CB reads 3.9\n \nkΩ from the \nthermistor and turns harvest termination over to the harvest timer (S4 dip switch 1 & 2). \nThe harvest timer has settings of 60, 90, 120, and 180 sec. The pump\n-\nout timer (S4 dip \nswitch 3 & 4) acts in place of the harvest timer during cycles with a pump\n-\nout (S4 dip \nswitch 5 & 6). WV remains energized during harvest for a maximum of 6 min. or the \nlength of harvest, whichever is shorter. \na) \nComp Diagnosis\n: Check that evaporator is warming. If not, confirm that Comp \nenergizes. If not, check for 115VAC at CB K1 #1 or #9 (V) to neutral (W). If 115VAC is \nnot present, check for 115VAC at CB K1 #7 or #10 (BR) to neutral (W). If 115VAC is \npresent at #7 or #10 (BR) and not at #1 or #9 (V), replace CB. If 115VAC is present, \ncheck for 115VAC at CR or MC solenoid. If 115VAC is present, confirm contacts are \nclosed. If not, replace CR or MC. If CR or MC contacts are closed, check Comp \nexternal overload, Comp start and run capacitors, Comp start relay, and Comp motor \nwinding.\nb)\n HGV Diagnosis\n: If Comp is energized and evaporator is not warming, check that \nHGV energizes and opens. Check for 115VAC at CB K1 #2 (P) to neutral (W). \nIf 115VAC is not present, replace CB. If 115VAC is present, check for 115VAC at HGV \ncoil and check HGV coil continuity. Replace as needed.\nc)\n LLV Diagnosis\n: Confirm that LLV is de-energized and closed (not bypassing). \nIf energized, replace CB. If de-energized and bypassing, replace LLV.\nd) \nWRV Diagnosis\n: Confirm WRV is not leaking by.\n20\ne)\n Initial Harvest Cycle Termination Diagnosis\n: When the thermistor reaches 48°F \n(9°C), CB reads 3.9\n \nkΩ from the thermistor and turns harvest termination over to \nthe harvest timer (S4 dip switch 1 & 2). Check discharge line temperature. For a \nthermistor check, see \"II.F. Thermistor Check.\" If 1-min. fill cycle starts after harvest \ntimer terminates, check that FS is clean and operating properly, see \"II.E. Float \nSwitch Check and Cleaning.\" If FS is closed, CB proceeds to the next cycle. If not, \nreplace CB. \nNote: The minimum total time allowed by CB for a complete harvest cycle is 2 min. \nMaximum harvest time allowed is 20 min.\nNOTICE!\n On models with \"G\" control board and no harvest pump timer relays, \nS4 dip switch 7 must remain off. Otherwise, PM energizes in reverse direction the \nlast 50 seconds of harvest and empties water from water tank.\n \n6) \nFreeze Cycle – LED 1 is on.\n Comp and FMR continue. PM, FM, and LLV energize. \nWV and HGV de\n-\nenergize. Appliance is held in freeze by a 5-min. short cycle protection \ntimer. \nAfter 5-min. timer terminates \nand FS opens, freeze cycle terminates. \na)\n Freeze Cycle Diagnosis:\n Confirm Comp and FMR continue. Confirm that \nPM, FM, and LLV energize. Confirm WRV opens. Next, confirm WV and HGV \nde\n-\nenergize. During the first 5\n \nmin. of freeze, confirm evaporator is cooling. If not, \nconfirm WV de-energized (not leaking by), HGV de-energized (not bypassing), \nLLV and FM energize, TXV and HM operate correctly, WRV opens, Comp is \nefficient, and refrigerant charge is correct. See \"VIII.A. Specification Sheet\" and \n\"VIII.B. Performance Data.\" \nb)\n Comp and FMR Diagnosis\n: If Comp and FMR de-energize once freeze begins, \ncheck that appliance has not shut off on HPS (\"POWER OK\" LED off). If so, check \n\"3)b) HPS Diagnosis\" above. If \"POWER OK\" LED is on, check for 115VAC at CB \nK1 #1 (V) or #9 (V) to neutral (W). If 115VAC is not present and LED 1 is on, replace \nCB. If 115VAC is present, check for 115VAC at CR or MC coil. If 115VAC is present, \ncheck CR or MC coil and contact continuity. Replace as needed. If CR or MC is ok, \ncheck Comp external overload, start relay, and start and run capacitors. Next, check \nComp motor winding continuity. If Comp is energized but evaporator is not cooling, \ncheck for an inefficient Comp. See \"VIII.B. Performance Data.\" If Comp is energized \nbut FMR is not, check for 115VAC at the FMR junction box. If 115VAC is not present, \ncheck icemaker wiring connections. If 115VAC is present, check for voltage at \ncondenser unit. If 115VAC is not present, check field wiring connections. If 115VAC is \npresent, check FMR capacitor, motor winding, and fan blade for binding.\nc)\n WV and HGV Diagnosis\n: If WV is energized, check for 115VAC at CB K1 #6 (O) to \nneutral (W). If 115VAC is present after PM energizes, replace CB. If 115VAC is not \npresent, replace WV (bypassing). If HGV did not de-energize, check for 115VAC at \nCB K1 #2 (P) to neutral (W). If 115VAC is present after PM energizes, replace CB. \nIf 115VAC is not present, replace HGV (bypassing).\n21\nd)\n PM Diagnosis\n: Confirm water is flowing over evaporator from PM and not WV. If PM \nde-energizes once freeze begins, check for 115VAC at CB K1 #4 (R) to neutral (W). \nIf 115VAC is not present, replace CB. If 115VAC is present and PM is de-energized, \ncheck for 115VAC at control switch #5 (R) to neutral (W). If 115VAC is present at CB \nK1 #4 (R) and not at control switch #5 (R), check control switch continuity between \n#5 (R) and #4 (R). Replace as needed. If 115VAC is present at control switch #5 (R) \nto neutral (W), check PM capacitor and motor winding continuity.\ne)\n FM and LLV Diagnosis\n: If FM or LLV does not energize, check for 115VAC at CB \nK1 #3 (BK) to neutral (W). If 115VAC is not present, replace CB. If 115VAC is present: \n \nFor FM, check capacitor, motor winding, and blade for binding. \n \nFor LLV, check coil voltage and continuity. \nf)\n Refrigerant Pressures, HM, and TXV Diagnosis\n: If evaporator is still not cooling, \ncheck refrigerant pressures. See \"VIII.B. Performance Data.\" \n \nNext, check HM operation. If refrigeration pressures are above HM setpoint and \nHM is bypassing, replace HM. Check TXV for proper operation. Remove TXV bulb \nand hold it in your hand, refrigerant low-side pressure should rise, place TXV bulb in \nice water, refrigerant low-side pressure should drop. A 10 to 15 pound pressure swing \nbetween warm and cold conditions indicate a good TXV. If a 10 to 15 pound swing is \nnot present, replace TXV.\ng) \nWRV Diagnosis\n: WRV is factory set and generally no adjustment is required. \nIf WRV fails to open in freeze, check for proper refrigerant pressures. See \"VIII.B. \nPerformance Data.\" If refrigerant pressures are correct and WRV does not open, \nadjust or replace as needed. See \"IV.C. Water Regulating Valve Adjustment \n(water\n-\ncooled models).\"\nh)\n Freeze Termination Diagnosis:\n After 5\n \nmin. in freeze, disconnect CB K5 FS \nconnector. 15 sec. later appliance should switch out of the freeze cycle (15 second \ndelay after FS opens before terminating the freeze cycle). If appliance remains in \nfreeze longer than 15 sec. after FS removed, replace CB. If appliance switches with \nFS removed but would previously not switch out of freeze with FS connected (long \nfreeze - 3 beep alarm), see \"II.E. Float Switch Check and Cleaning.\" \nNote: Normal freeze cycle will last 20 to 40 min. depending on model and conditions. \nCycle times and pressures should follow performance data provided in this \nmanual. See \"VIII.B. Performance Data.\"\ni)\n Short Freeze Cycle Diagnosis\n: Confirm water tank fills and overflows during 1 min. \nfill and harvest cycles. If not, check water supply filters, shut-off valve, WV screen. \nIf water tank empties before 5 min. timer terminates and freeze cycle is short, check \nthat CV is not leaking by (water flowing down the potable drain). If CV is leaking by, \nremove and clean CV, replace rubber seat and spring if necessary. If water tank is \nfull, see \"II.E. Float Switch Check and Cleaning\" for erratic operating FS.\n22\n7) \nPump-Out Cycle – LEDs 1, 3, and 2 are on (10/20 second pump-out). \nTiming of the \nfirst pump-out is dependent on CB. \"E\" CB first pump\n-\nout is after the first freeze cycle. \n\"G\" CB first pump-out is determined by S4 dip switch 5 & 6. See the table below.\n\"E\" & \"G\" Control Board Settings\n1st Pump-Out\nS4 Dip Switch Setting\nPump-Out \nFrequency\n\"E\" Control Board\n\"G\" Control Board\nNo. 5\nNo. 6\nOFF\nOFF\nEvery cycle\nAfter 1st freeze cycle\nAfter 2nd freeze cycle\nON\nOFF\nEvery 2 cycles\nAfter 3rd freeze cycle\nOFF\nON\nEvery 5 cycles\nAfter 6th freeze cycle\nON\nON\nEvery 10 cycles\nAfter 11th freeze cycle\nComp and FMR continue, HGV energizes. If S4 dip switch 3 & 4 are set to 3 off and 4 \non, LED 4 turns on and WV energizes. FM and LLV de\n-\nenergize. PM stops for 2 sec., \nthen reverses for 10/20 sec. depending on pump\n-\nout timer (S4 dip switch 3 & 4) setting. \nWhen the pump\n-\nout timer terminates, pump\n-\nout is complete. The pump-out frequency \ncontrol (S4 dip switch 5 & 6) is factory set, and generally no adjustment is required. \nHowever, the pump\n-\nout frequency control can be set to have a pump\n-\nout occur every \ncycle, or every 2, 5, or 10 cycles. For details, see \"III.C.4. Pump\n-\nOut Frequency Control \n(S4 dip switch 5 & 6).\"\nPump-Out Diagnosis\n: In the freeze cycle before pump-out (see table above), \ndisconnect CB black K5 connector (FS connector) after 5 min. of freeze. Check that PM \nstops and re-starts and water is flowing down the drain through CV. If PM does not stop \nand re-start, check that CB LEDs 1, 3, and 2 are on. If not, replace CB. If LEDs 1, 3, \nand 2 are on and PM does not energize, check for 115VAC at \n \nCB K1 #5 (DBU) to neutral (W). If 115VAC is not present, replace CB. \n \nIf 115VAC is present, make sure the drain line is not clogged and that CV is clean and \noperating properly.\nConfirm FM and LLV de-energize. If FM or LLV is energized with LEDs 1, 3, and 2 on, \nreplace CB.\n8) \nNormal Harvest Cycle\n – Same as the initial harvest cycle. Return to step 5 above. \nNote: Appliance continues to cycle until TBC or MBC is satisfied or power is turned off. \nThe appliance always restarts at the 1-min. fill cycle. \n23\n9) \nShutdown\na)\n Thermostatic Bin Control (TBC): \nWhen the appliance is running, hold ice in contact with the thermostatic bulb. TBC \nswitch opens within 10 sec., shutting down the appliance. TBC is factory set, and \ngenerally no adjustment is required. However, adjustment may be needed in some \nconditions, particularly at higher altitude locations.\nNOTICE\n• On \"E\" control boards, do not adjust S4 dip switch 7 out of the factory default \nposition. This dip switch must be left in the factory default position or the \nappliance will not operate correctly. \n• On \"G\" control boards, CB red K4 connector jumper (4A4883G01) must be in \nplace.

Next, check CT continuity. If open, replace CT.  \nb)\n HPS Diagnosis:\n Check that the condenser coil is not clogged or restricted. Let \nrefrigeration circuit pressures equalize. If HPS does not reset and pressures are \nequalized, replace HPS. If pressures are not equalized, reclaim refrigerant and \ndiagnose refrigeration circuit restriction. Check that there are no restrictions in the \nrefrigeration circuit. \n \nHarvest Cycle: HGV, strainer, or check valve. \n \nFreeze Cycle: FM, FMR, TXV, WRV, HM, LLV, strainer, check valve, drier, and \ndamaged line set or fitting. \n \nConfirm that the location meets installation requirements: \n• The appliance is not intended for outdoor use. Normal operating ambient temperature \nshould be within 45°F to 100°F (7°C to 38°C). \n• Allow 6\" (15 cm) clearance at rear, sides, and top for proper air circulation and ease \nof maintenance and/or service should they be required.\n• The appliance should not be located in a corrosive environment.\n25\n4) \n1-Min. Fill Cycle – LED 4 is on.\n WV and X11 relay energize. After 1\n \nmin., CB checks for \na closed FS. If FS is closed, the harvest cycle begins. If harvest cycle begins (Comp, \nHGV, FMR energized), continue to step 5a. If FS is open, WV\n \nremains energized \nthrough additional 1-min. fill cycles until water enters the water tank and FS closes \n(low water safety protection during initial start up and at the end of each harvest). \nDiagnosis:\n Check that water enters the water tank. If not, check that the water supply \nline shut-off valve is open and screens or external filters are clear. Check for 115VAC \nat CB K1 #6 (O) to neutral (W). If 115VAC is not present, replace CB. If 115VAC is \npresent, and WV does not energize, check for 115VAC at WV. If 115VAC is present, \ncheck coil continuity. If open, replace WV. If the water tank fills, but the appliance fails to \nstart harvest (Comp energized), check for open FS. See \"II.E. Float Switch Check and \nCleaning.\" If FS is closed and CB fails to start the harvest cycle after 1 min., replace CB.\n5a) \nInitial Harvest Cycle – LEDs 1, 4, and 2 are on.\n WV and X11 relay continue. Comp, \nFMR, HGV, and X10 relay energize. CB monitors the warming of the evaporator via the \nthermistor located on the suction line. When the thermistor reaches 48°F (9°C), CB \nreads 3.9 kΩ from the thermistor and turns harvest termination over to the harvest timer \n(S4 dip switch 1 & 2). The harvest timer has settings of 60, 90, 120, and 180 sec. The \npump\n-\nout timer (S4 dip switch 3 & 4) acts in place of the harvest timer during cycles \nwith a pump-out (S4 dip switch 5 & 6). WV and X11 relay are energized during harvest \nfor a maximum of 6 min. or the length of harvest minus 50 sec., whichever is shorter. \n50 sec. before harvest terminates, PM energizes. See step 5b below.\na) \nComp Diagnosis\n: Check that evaporator is warming. If not, confirm that Comp \nenergizes. If not, check for 115VAC at CB K1 #1 or #9 (V) to neutral (W). If 115VAC is \nnot present, check for 115VAC at CB K1 #7 or #10 (BR) to neutral (W). If 115VAC is \npresent at #7 or #10 (BR) and not at #1 or #9 (V), replace CB. If 115VAC is present, \ncheck for 115VAC at CR or MC solenoid. If 115VAC is present, confirm contacts are \nclosed. If not, replace CR or MC. If CR or MC contacts are closed, check Comp \nexternal overload, Comp start and run capacitors, Comp start relay, and Comp \nmotor winding. If Comp is energized and evaporator is not warming, check that HGV \nenergizes and opens. Check for 115VAC at CB K1 #2 (P) to a neutral (W). If 115VAC \nis not present and LED 2 is on, replace CB. If 115VAC is present, check coil voltage \nand continuity. Replace as needed. Confirm that LLV is de-energized and closed (not \nbypassing). If energized, replace CB. If de-energized and bypassing, replace LLV. \nConfirm WRV is not leaking by. If evaporator is warming, \nPM energizes for the last 50 \nsec. of harvest.\nb) \nHGV Diagnosis\n: \nIf Comp is energized and evaporator is not warming, check that \nHGV energizes and opens. Check for 115VAC at CB K1 #2 (P) to neutral (W). \nIf 115VAC is not present, replace CB. If 115VAC is present, check for 115VAC at HGV \ncoil and check HGV coil continuity. Replace as needed.\nc) \nLLV Diagnosis\n: Confirm that LLV is de-energized and closed (not bypassing). If \nenergized, replace CB. If de-energized and bypassing, replace LLV.\nd) \nWRV Diagnosis\n: Confirm WRV is not leaking by. \n26\n5b) \nHarvest Pump Timer – LEDs 1, 3, and 2 are on. \nWhen the thermistor reaches 48°F \n(9°C), CB reads 3.9\n \nkΩ from the thermistor and turns harvest termination over to the \nharvest timer (S4 dip switch 1 & 2). 50 sec. before the harvest timer terminates, LED \n3 turns on and PM energizes. Comp, FMR, HGV, and X10 relay continue. LED 4 turns \noff, WV and X11 relay de\n-\nenergize. \n \nDiagnosis\n:\n \nPlace a thermometer on the suction line next to the thermistor. Has it \nwarmed to 48°F (9°C) or warmer? Confirm thermistor status. See \"II.F. Thermistor \nCheck.\" If the thermistor reading is in proper range, dip switch 7 is on, and PM does \nnot energize 50 sec. before harvest terminates, replace CB. If WV continues, check for \n115VAC at CB K1 #6 (O). If 115VAC is present, and LED 4 is off, replace CB. If LED 3 is \non and PM is not energized, check for 115VAC at CB K1 #5 (DBU). If 115VAC is not \npresent, replace CB. If 115VAC is present and PM is not energized, check for 115VAC \nat X10 relay terminal #7 (Y) to neutral (W). If 115VAC is not present, check for 115VAC \nat X10 relay terminal #3 (P) to neutral (W) and X10 relay terminal #5 (Y) to neutral (W). \nIf 115VAC is present on terminal #3 (P) and not on terminal #5 (Y), replace X10 relay. \nIf 115VAC is present on X10 relay terminal #7 (Y) and PM is not energized, check for \n115VAC at X10 relay terminal #4 (R) to neutral (W) and terminal #6 (DBU) to neutral \n(W). If 115VAC is present on terminal #6 (DBU) and not on terminal #4 (R), replace X10 \nrelay. If 115VAC is present on X10 relay terminal #4 (R), check control switch contact \ncontinuity between terminals #4 (R) and #5 (R). If contacts are open, replace control \nswitch. If contacts are closed and 115VAC is present between control switch terminal #5 \n(R) and neutral (W), check PM capacitor and motor winding continuity. \n5c)\n Initial Harvest Cycle Termination Diagnosis\n: When the thermistor reaches 48°F \n(9°C), CB reads 3.9\n \nkΩ from the thermistor and turns harvest termination over to the \nharvest timer (S4 dip switch 1 & 2). Check discharge line temperature. For a thermistor \ncheck, see \"II.F. Thermistor Check.\" If 1-min. fill cycle starts after harvest timer \nterminates, check that FS is clean and operating properly, see \"II.E. Float Switch Check \nand Cleaning.\" If FS is closed, CB proceeds to the next cycle. If not, replace CB.\nNote: The minimum total time allowed by CB for a complete harvest cycle is 2 min. \nMaximum harvest time allowed is 20 min.\nNOTICE!\n S4 dip switch 7 must remain on. Otherwise, PM will not energize during \nthe last 50 sec. of harvest.\n27\n 6) \nFreeze Cycle – LED 1 is on.\n Comp, FMR, and PM continue. FM and LLV energize. \nHGV and X10 relay de\n-\nenergize. \nAppliance is held in freeze by a 5-min. short cycle \nprotection timer. After 5-min. timer terminates and FS opens, freeze cycle terminates.\n \n \nNote: PM power supply switches from CB K1 #5\n (DBU)\n in harvest to K1 #4 (R) in freeze.\na)\n Freeze Cycle Diagnosis\n: Confirm Comp, FMR, and PM continue. Confirm that \nFM and LLV energize. Confirm WRV opens. Next, confirm HGV and X10 relay \nde-energize. During the first 5\n \nmin. of freeze, confirm evaporator is cooling. If not, \nconfirm WV de-energized (not leaking by), HGV de-energized (not bypassing), \nLLV and FM energize, TXV and HM operate correctly, WRV opens, Comp is \nefficient, and refrigerant charge is correct. See \"VIII.A. Specification Sheet\" and \n\"VIII.B. Performance Data.\" \nb)\n Comp and FMR Diagnosis\n: If Comp and FMR de-energize once freeze begins, \ncheck that appliance has not shut off on HPS (\"POWER OK\" LED off). If so, check \n\"3)b) HPS Diagnosis\" above. If \"POWER OK\" LED is on, check for 115VAC at CB K1 \n#1 (V) or #9 (V) to neutral (W). If 115VAC is not present and LED 1 is on, replace CB. \nIf 115VAC is present, check for 115VAC at CR or MC coil. If 115VAC is present, check \nCR or MC coil and contact continuity. Replace as needed. If CR or MC is okay, check \nComp start relay and start and run capacitors. Next, check Comp motor winding \ncontinuity. If Comp is energized but evaporator is not cooling, check for an inefficient \nComp. See \"VIII.B. Performance Data.\" If Comp is energized but FMR is not, check \nfor 115VAC at the FMR junction box. If 115VAC is not present, check icemaker wiring \nconnections. If 115VAC is present, check for voltage at condenser unit. If 115VAC \nis not present, check field wiring connections. If 115VAC is present, check FMR \ncapacitor, motor winding, and fan blade for binding.\nc)\n WV and HGV Diagnosis\n: If WV is energized, check for 115VAC at CB K1 #6 (O) to \nneutral (W). If 115VAC is present after PM energizes in harvest cycle, replace CB. \nIf 115VAC is not present, replace WV (bypassing). If HGV did not de\n-\nenergize at \nthe end of harvest, check for 115VAC at CB K1 #2 (P) to neutral (W). If 115VAC is \npresent 50 sec. after PM energizes, replace CB. If 115VAC is not present, replace \nHGV (bypassing). \nd) \nPM Diagnosis\n: Confirm water is flowing over evaporator from PM and not WV. If PM \nde-energizes once freeze begins, check for 115VAC at CB K1 #4 (R) to neutral (W). \nIf 115VAC is not present, replace CB. If 115VAC is present and PM is de-energized, \ncheck for 115VAC at control switch #5 (R) to neutral (W). If 115VAC is present at CB \nK1 #4 (R) and not at control switch #5 (R), check control switch continuity between \n#5 (R) and #4 (R). Replace as needed. If 115VAC is present at control switch #5 (R) \nto neutral (W), check PM capacitor and motor winding continuity. \ne)\n FM and LLV Diagnosis\n: If FM or LLV does not energize, check for 115VAC at CB \nK1 #3 (BK) to neutral (W). If 115VAC is not present, replace CB. If 115VAC is present: \n \nFor FM, check capacitor, motor winding, and blade for binding. \n \nFor LLV, check coil voltage and continuity. \n28\nf)\n Refrigerant Pressures, HM, and TXV Diagnosis\n: If evaporator is still not cooling, \ncheck refrigerant pressures. See \"VIII.B. Performance Data.\" \n \nNext, check HM operation. If refrigeration pressures are above HM setpoint and \nHM is bypassing, replace HM. Check TXV for proper operation. Remove TXV bulb \nand hold it in your hand, refrigerant low-side pressure should rise, place TXV bulb in \nice water, refrigerant low-side pressure should drop. A 10 to 15 pound pressure swing \nbetween warm and cold conditions indicate a good TXV. If a 10 to 15 pound swing is \nnot present, replace TXV.\ng)\n WRV Diagnosis\n: WRV is factory set and generally no adjustment is required. \nIf WRV fails to open in freeze, check for proper refrigerant pressures. See \"VIII.B. \nPerformance Data.\" If refrigerant pressures are correct and WRV does not open, \nadjust or replace as needed. See \"IV.C. Water Regulating Valve Adjustment \n(water\n-\ncooled models).\" \nh)\n Freeze Termination Diagnosis:\n After 5\n \nmin. in freeze, disconnect CB K5 FS \nconnector. 15 sec. later appliance should switch out of the freeze cycle (15 second \ndelay after FS opens before terminating the freeze cycle). If appliance remains in \nfreeze longer than 15 sec. after FS removed, replace CB. If appliance switches with \nFS removed but would previously not switch out of freeze with FS connected (long \nfreeze - 3 beep alarm), see \"II.E. Float Switch Check and Cleaning.\" \nNote: Normal freeze cycle will last 20 to 40 min. depending on model and conditions. \nCycle times and pressures should follow performance data provided in this \nmanual. See \"VIII.B. Performance Data.\"\ni)\n Short Freeze Cycle Diagnosis\n: Confirm water tank fills and overflows during 1 min. \nfill and harvest cycles. If not, check water supply filters, shut-off valve, WV screen. \nIf water tank empties before 5 min. timer terminates and freeze cycle is short, check \nthat CV is not leaking by (water flowing down the potable drain). If CV is leaking by, \nremove and clean CV, replace rubber seat and spring if necessary. If water tank is \nfull, see \"II.E. Float Switch Check and Cleaning.\" for erratic operating FS.\n7) \nPump-Out Cycle – LEDs 1, 3, and 2 are on (10/20 second pump-out). \nTiming of the \nfirst pump-out is determined by S4 dip switch 5 & 6. See the table below.\n\"G\" Control Board Settings\nS4 Dip Switch Setting\nPump-Out \nFrequency\n\"G\" Control Board\nNo. 5\nNo. 6\nOFF\nOFF\nEvery cycle\nAfter 2nd freeze cycle\nON\nOFF\nEvery 2 cycles\nAfter 3rd freeze cycle\nOFF\nON\nEvery 5 cycles\nAfter 6th freeze cycle\nON\nON\nEvery 10 cycles\nAfter 11th freeze cycle\nComp and FMR continue, HGV energizes. If S4 dip switch 3 & 4 are set to 3 off \nand 4 on, LED 4 turns on and WV and X11 relay energize, energizing X10 relay. \nNOTICE!\n S4 dip switch 3 & 4 must not be set to 3 off and 4 on. Otherwise, PM \nwill rotate in freeze cycle direction instead of pump-out direction. \nFM and LLV \nde\n-\nenergize. PM stops for 2 sec., then reverses for 10/20 sec. depending on pump\n-\nout \ntimer (S4 dip switch 3 & 4) setting. When the pump\n-\nout timer terminates, pump\n-\nout \n29\nis complete. The pump-out frequency control (S4 dip switch 5\n \n& 6) is factory set, and \ngenerally no adjustment is required. However, the pump\n-\nout frequency control can be \nset to have a pump-out occur every cycle, or every 2, 5, or 10 cycles. For details, see \n\"III.C.4. Pump\n-\nOut Frequency Control (S4 dip switch 5 & 6).\"\nPump-Out Diagnosis\n: In the freeze cycle before pump-out (see table above), after \n5 min. of freeze disconnect CB black K5 connector (FS connector). Check that PM \nstops and re-starts and that PM rotation is correct (water flowing down the drain through \nCV). If PM does not stop and re-start, check that CB LEDs 1, 3, and 2 are on. If not, \nreplace CB. If LEDs 1, 3, and 2 are on and PM does not energize, check for 115VAC \nat CB K1 #5 (DBU) to neutral (W). If 115VAC is not present, replace CB. If 115VAC \nis present, check that X10 relay is de-energized. If not, check X11 relay status. If X11 \nrelay is energized, replace CB. If X11 relay is de-energized and X10 relay is energized, \nreplace X11 relay (contacts sticking). If X10 relay is de-energized, check for 115VAC \nat terminal #6 (DBU) to neutral (W) and terminal #2 (DBU) to neutral (W). If 115VAC is \npresent on terminal #6 (DBU) and not on terminal #2 (DBU), replace X10 relay. If PM is \nenergized and rotating in pump-out rotation, make sure the drain line is not clogged and \nthat CV is clean and operating properly. \nConfirm FM and LLV de-energize. If FM or LLV are energized with LEDs 1, 3, and 2 on, \nreplace CB.\n8) \nNormal Harvest Cycle\n – Same as the initial harvest cycle. Return to step 5a) above. \nNote: Appliance continues to cycle until MBC is satisfied or power is switched off. The \nappliance always restarts at the 1-min. fill cycle.\n9) \nShutdown\n Mechanical Bin Control: \nSee \"II.D.2.

This procedure will help you verify your \ndiagnosis.\nAlarm Reset: If CB is in alarm (beeping), press the \"ALARM RESET\" button on CB \nwhile CB is beeping. \nWARNING! Risk of electric shock. Care should be \ntaken not to touch live terminals.\n Once reset, the icemaker starts at the \n1-minute fill cycle. For audible alarm information, see \"III.B. LED Lights and \nAudible Alarm Safeties.\"\n1) Check the dip switch settings to assure that S4 dip switch 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10 and S5\n \ndip \nswitch 1 through 5 (\"G\" CB) are in the factory default position. S4 dip switch\n \n1, 2, 5, 6 \nare cleaning adjustments and the settings are flexible. For factory default settings, see \n\"III.C.1. Default Dip Switch Settings.\"\n2) Move the control switch to the \"ICE\" position. If the red \"POWER OK\" LED is on, control \nvoltage is good, continue to step 3. If the \"POWER OK\" LED is off, check CT secondary \ncircuit. CT output is 10.5VAC at 115VAC primary input. If the secondary circuit has \nproper voltage and the red LED is off, replace CB.\n \nIf the secondary circuit does not have proper voltage, check CT primary circuit. Check \nfor 115VAC at CB K1 connector pin #10 (BR) to neutral (W) for 115VAC. Always choose \na white (W) neutral wire to establish a good neutral connection when checking voltages. \nFor additional checks, see \"II.G.1. No Ice Production.\"\n3)\n \nThe \"OUTPUT TEST\" button provides a relay sequence test. Make sure the control \nswitch is in the \"ICE\" position, then press the \"OUTPUT TEST\" button. For the correct \nlighting sequence, see the table below.

With the water tank full, FS should be closed. \nIf FS is closed and the icemaker will not switch from the 1-min. fill cycle to the initial \nharvest cycle, replace CB.\nIf FS is open, confirm that the water tank is full. If the water tank is not full, check the \nwater supply, water filters, and inlet water valve. If the water tank is full, follow the \nsteps in \"II.E.2. Float Switch Cleaning.\" After cleaning FS, check it again. Replace if \nnecessary.\nLegend: \nCB\n–control board;\n FS\n–float switch\n2. Float Switch Cleaning\nDepending on local water conditions, scale may build up on FS. Scale on the switch can \ncause the float to stick. In this case, FS should be cleaned. \n1) Turn off the power supply. \n2) Remove the front panel, then move the control switch to the \"OFF\" position.\n3) Drain the water tank.\na)  On KM-320M_H, KM-515M_H, KM-600M_H, KM-650M_H, and KM-901M_H, \nremove the base cover, then disconnect one end of the pump tubing to drain the \nwater tank. See Fig. 3. After the water tank has drained, reconnect the pump tubing.\nb) On KM-1340M_H and KM-1601M_H, remove the rubber cap covering the overflow \npipe in the water tank. Remove the overflow pipe by turning it counterclockwise. After \nthe water tank has drained, replace the overflow pipe and the rubber cap in their \ncorrect positions. Note: Be sure the overflow pipe o-ring is in its correct position on \nthe overflow pipe.\n4) Disconnect the vent tube and the flush tube from the top of FS, then remove FS \nassembly and remove the rubber boot from the bottom of FS assembly. See Fig.\n \n4.\n5) Remove the retainer rod from the bottom of FS housing, then remove the float. Be \ncareful not to bend the retainer rod excessively when removing it.\n6) Wipe down FS housing, shaft, float, and retainer rod with a mixture of 1\n \npart Hoshizaki \n\"Scale Away\" and 25 parts warm water. Clean the inside of the rubber boot and hose \nwith cleaning solution. Rinse the parts thoroughly with clean water.\n7) Reassemble FS assembly and replace it and the rubber boot in their correct positions. \nReconnect the vent tube and the flush tube.\n8) Move the control switch to the \"ICE\" position. \n9) Replace the base cover (if applicable) and \nfront panel in their correct positions.\n10) Turn on the power supply to start the \nautomatic icemaking process.\nLegend: \nCB\n–control board; \nFS\n–float switch\nFig. 4\nFloat\nFloat Switch \nHousing\nRubber Boot \nand Hose\nRetainer Rod\nFlush \nVent \nShaft \n36\nF. Thermistor Check\nTo check thermistor resistance, follow the steps below.\n1) Turn off the power supply. \n2) Remove the front panel. Move the control switch to the \"OFF\" position.\n3) Remove the control box cover.\n4) Remove the thermistor from the refrigerant tubing. \n5) Immerse the thermistor sensor portion in a glass containing ice and water for 2 or \n3\n \nmin.\n6) Disconnect the thermistor connector from CB K3 connector and check the resistance \nbetween thermistor leads. Normal range is 4.7\n \nto 6.2\n \nkΩ. If outside the normal range, \nreplace the thermistor. See \"IV.B. Component Service Information.\" If within the normal \nrange, continue to the next step.\n7) Replace the thermistor in its correct position. See \"IV.B. Component Service \nInformation.\"\n8) Reconnect the thermistor connector to CB K3 connector.\n9) Replace the control box cover in its correct position.\n10) Move the control switch to the \"ICE\" position. \n11) Replace the front panel in its correct position.\n12) Turn on the power supply.\n13) Once the harvest cycle starts (Comp energizes), begin timing the harvest cycle.\n14) The harvest timer and harvest cycle should terminate within 2 to 5 min. If the harvest \ncycle does not terminate within 2 to 5 min., replace CB.\nLegend: \nCB\n–control board; \nComp\n–compressor\n37\nG. Diagnostic Tables\n1.

Controls and Adjustments\n• \nA Hoshizaki exclusive control board is employed in KM series appliances.\n• \nAll models are pretested and factory adjusted.\n• \nFor a control board check procedure, see \"II.C. Control Board Check.\"\nNOTICE\n• Fragile, handle very carefully.\n• The control board contains integrated circuits, which are susceptible to failure \ndue to static discharge. It is especially important to touch the metal part of the \nicemaker when handling or replacing the control board.\n• Do not touch the electronic devices on the control board or the back of the control \nboard.\n• Do not change wiring and connections. Do not misconnect K3 WHITE, K4 RED, \nand K5 BLACK, because the same connector is used for the thermistor, \nmechanical bin control, and float switch. K4 RED is not used on \"E\" control board \nmodels.\n• Do not short out power supply to test for voltage.\n• Always replace the whole control board assembly if it goes bad.\n42\nA.

The harvest \ntimer is factory set, and generally no adjustment is required. However, a setting longer \nthan the factory setting may be advised in cases where the drain provided at harvest \nneeds to be prolonged for extra cleaning. Before changing this setting, contact Hoshizaki \nTechnical Support at 1\n-\n800\n-\n233-1940 for recommendations. Keep in mind that setting the \nharvest timer to a longer setting decreases 24-hour production.\nNote that the pump-out timer (S4 dip switch 3 & 4) acts in place of the harvest timer \nduring cycles with a pump out. For details, see \"III.C.3. Pump-Out Timer (S4 dip switch \n3 & 4).\"\n \nNote: On models with a pump-out every cycle, the harvest timer is only relevant during \nthe initial harvest cycle since a pump out occurs every cycle thereafter. \nS4 Dip Switch Setting\nTime\n \n(sec.)\nNo. 1\nNo. 2\nOFF\nOFF\n60\nON\nOFF\n90\nOFF\nON\n120\nON\nON\n180\n3. Pump-Out Timer (S4 dip switch 3 & 4)\nNOTICE\n• On KM-515M_H models without harvest pump timer operation, never \nadjust the pump-out timer's harvest timer (T2) for a time less than \n150\n \nsec. Otherwise, the icemaker will not perform properly. \n• On models with harvest pump timer, do not adjust 3 off and 4 on. Pump \ndoes not run in pump-out rotation in this setting.\nWhen a pump-out is called for, the pump motor stops for 2 sec., then energizes in the \nreverse direction, taking water from the bottom of the water tank and forcing pressure \nagainst the check valve seat allowing water to go through the check valve and down \nthe drain. At the same time, water flows through the small tube to power flush the float \nswitch. The pump motor drains the water tank for the time determined by the pump-out \ntimer. The pump\n-\nout timer also acts in place of the harvest timer during cycles with a \npump\n-\nout. The pump-out timer is factory set, and generally no adjustment is required. \nHowever, where water quality is bad and the icemaker needs a longer pump-out time, \nthe pump\n-\nout timer can be adjusted. The pump\n-\nout timer control can be set to pump-out \nfor 10 or 20 sec.\nS4 Dip Switch Setting\nTime (sec.)\nInlet Water \nValve\nNo. 3\nNo. 4\nT1\nT2\nOFF\nOFF\n10\n150\nClosed\nON\nOFF\n10\n180\nClosed\nOFF\nON\n10\n120\nOpen\nON\nON\n20\n180\nClosed\nT1: Time to drain the water tank\nT2: Harvest timer at pump out\n48\n4. Pump-Out Frequency Control (S4 dip switch 5 & 6)\nNOTICE\nDo not adjust on KM-515M_H without harvest pump timer. Adjustments to this setting \non KM-515M_H without harvest pump timer may adversely affect performance and \nwarranty coverage.\nThe pump-out frequency control is factory set to drain the water tank every 10\n \ncycles \non all KM-320M_H, KM-600MAH, KM-650M_H, KM-901M_H/3 and on KM-515MAH \nwith harvest pump timer, and every cycle on KM-515M_H without harvest pump timer. \nGenerally no adjustment is required. However, where water quality is bad and the \nicemaker needs a pump-out more often, the pump\n-\nout frequency can be adjusted. The \npump-out frequency control can be set to have a pump\n-\nout occur every cycle, or every \n2,\n \n5, or 10 cycles. \nTiming of the first pump-out is dependent on the control board. On \"E\" control boards, the \nfirst pump\n-\nout is after the first freeze cycle. On \"G\" control boards, the first pump-out is \ndependent on S4 dip switch 5 & 6.

Bin Control Selector or Harvest Pump Timer Operation (S4 dip switch 7)\nDepending on the control board, S4 dip switch 7 is used for either bin control selection or \nharvest pump timer operation.\n(1) Bin Control Selector, \"E\" Control Board\nNOTICE\nDo not adjust. This dip switch must be left in the factory default position or the \nicemaker will not operate correctly.\nWhen set to on position on an icemaker with a thermostatic bin control, a 5-beep alarm \nsounds (open circuit) and the icemaker does not operate.\n\"E\" Control Board\nS4 Dip Switch Setting\nBin Control\nNo. 7\nON\nMechanical (requires resistor wire harness)\nOFF\nThermostatic\n49\n(2) Harvest Pump Timer, \"G\" Control Board\nNOTICE\nFactory set for proper operation. Do not adjust. Adjustment outside of the factory \ndefault setting may result in damage to the appliance. \nDepending on the harvest pump timer setting, the pump motor either stays off or is \nenergized the last 50 seconds of harvest. When the pump motor is energized, water \ncirculates over the evaporator. The harvest water valve is open during harvest for a \nmaximum of 6 minutes or the length of harvest minus 0 or 50 seconds (determined by \nthe harvest pump timer setting), whichever is shorter. \n \nWhen S4 dip switch 7 is in the on position and harvest begins, X11 and X10 relays \nenergize. A latching circuit is created through the X11 and X10 relays. For further details, \nsee \"VIII.C. Wiring Diagrams.\"\n \n50 sec. before harvest termination, LED 4 turns off, inlet water valve and X11 relay \nde\n-\nenergize. X10 relay remains energized through the latching circuit. Next, LED 3 turns \non and control board K1 connector pin #5 (DBU wire) energizes, energizing the pump \nmotor for the last 50 sec. of harvest.\n \n\"G\" Control Board\nS4 Dip Switch Setting\nPump Motor \nTime (sec.)\nNo. 7\nON\n50\nOFF\n0\n6.

Control Switch\nThe control switch has three positions: \"OFF\" for power off, \"ICE\" for icemaking, and\n\"WASH\" to energize the pump motor when cleaning and sanitizing.\n51\nIV. Refrigeration Circuit and Component Service Information\n WARNING\n• This appliance should be diagnosed and repaired only by qualified service \npersonnel to reduce the risk of death, electric shock, serious injury, or fire.\n• Move the control switch to the \"OFF\" position and turn off the power supply. Place \nthe disconnect in the \"OFF\" position. Lockout/Tagout to prevent the power supply \nfrom being turned back on inadvertently.\n• \nCHOKING HAZARD:\n Ensure all components, fasteners, and thumbscrews are \nsecurely in place after the icemaker is serviced. Make sure that none have fallen \ninto the dispenser unit/ice storage bin.\n• Make sure all food zones in the icemaker and dispenser unit/ice storage bin are \nclean after service. \nA. Refrigeration Circuit Service Information\n WARNING\n• Repairs requiring the refrigeration circuit to be opened must be performed by \nproperly trained and EPA-certified service personnel.\n• Use an electronic leak detector or soap bubbles to check for leaks. Add a trace of \nrefrigerant to the system (if using an electronic leak detector), and then raise the \npressure using nitrogen gas (140 PSIG). Do not use R\n-\n404A as a mixture with \npressurized air for leak testing.\nNOTICE\n• Always recover the refrigerant and store it in an approved container. Do not \ndischarge the refrigerant into the atmosphere.\n• Do not leave the system open for longer than 15 min. when replacing or servicing \nparts. The Polyol Ester (POE) oils used in R-404A applications can absorb \nmoisture quickly. Therefore it is important to prevent moisture from entering the \nsystem when replacing or servicing parts.\n• Always install a new drier every time the sealed refrigeration system is opened. \nDo not replace the drier until after all other repair or replacement has been made. \nInstall the new drier with the arrow on the drier in the direction of the refrigerant \nflow.\n• When brazing, protect the drier by using a wet cloth to prevent the drier from \noverheating. Do not allow the drier to exceed 250°F (121°C).\n1. Refrigerant Recovery\nThe icemaker is provided with refrigerant access valves. Using proper refrigerant practices, \nrecover the refrigerant. Store the refrigerant in an approved container. Do not discharge the \nrefrigerant into the atmosphere.\n52\n2. Brazing\n WARNING\n• R-404A itself is not flammable at atmospheric pressure and temperatures up to \n176°F (80°C).\n• R-404A itself is not explosive or poisonous. However, when exposed to high \ntemperatures (open flames), R-404A can be decomposed to form hydrofluoric \nacid and carbonyl fluoride both of which are hazardous.\n• Do not use silver alloy or copper alloy containing arsenic.\n1) Braze all fittings while purging with nitrogen gas flowing at a pressure of 3 to 4 PSIG.\nNote: Because the pipes in the evaporator case are specially coated to resist corrosion, \nit is important to make connections outside the evaporator case when possible. If \nit is necessary to braze inside the evaporator case, use sandpaper to remove the \ncoating from the brazing connections before unbrazing the components.\nNOTICE\n• Always install a new drier every time the sealed refrigeration system is opened. \n• Do not replace the drier until after all other repair or replacement has been made. \nInstall the new drier with the arrow on the drier in the direction of the refrigerant \nflow.\n• When brazing, protect the drier by using a wet cloth to prevent the drier from \noverheating. Do not allow the drier to exceed 250°F (121°C).\n2) Use an electronic leak detector or soap bubbles to check for leaks. Add a trace of \nrefrigerant to the system (if using an electronic leak detector), and then raise the \npressure using nitrogen gas (140 PSIG). Do not use R-404A as a mixture with \npressurized air for leak testing.\n3. Evacuation and Recharge (R-404A)\n1) Attach a vacuum pump to the system. Be sure to connect the charging hoses to both \nhigh and low-side refrigerant access valves. \nIMPORTANT\nThe vacuum level and vacuum pump may be the same as those for current \nrefrigerants. However, the rubber hose and gauge manifold to be used for \nevacuation and refrigerant charge should be exclusively for POE oils.\n2) Turn on the vacuum pump. Open the gauge manifold valves. Never allow the oil in the \nvacuum pump to flow backwards.\n3) Allow the vacuum pump to pull down to a 29.9\" Hg vacuum. Evacuating period depends \non pump capacity.\n4) Close the low-side valve and high-side valve on the gauge manifold.\n53\n5) Disconnect the gauge manifold hose from the vacuum pump and attach it to a \nrefrigerant service cylinder. Remember to loosen the connection and purge the air from \nthe hose. For the required refrigerant charge, see the rating label inside the icemaker. \nHoshizaki recommends only virgin refrigerant or reclaimed refrigerant which meets \nARI\n \nStandard 700 (latest edition) be used.\n6) A liquid charge is required when charging an R-404A system (to prevent fractionation). \nPlace the service cylinder on the scales; if the service cylinder is not equipped with \na dip tube, invert the service cylinder, then place it on the scales. Open the high-side \nvalve on the gauge manifold.\n7) Allow the system to charge with liquid until the proper charge weight is met.\n8) If necessary, add any remaining charge to the system through the low-side. \n \nNOTICE!\n To prevent compressor damage, use a throttling valve or liquid \ndispensing device to add the remaining liquid charge through the low-side \nrefrigerant access valve with the icemaker running.\n9) Close the high and low-side gauge manifold valves, then disconnect the gauge manifold \nhoses.\n10) Cap the refrigerant access valves to prevent a possible leak.\n54\nB. Component Service Information\nNOTICE\nWhen replacing a component listed below, see the notes to help ensure proper \noperation.\nComponent\nNotes\nCompressor\n1 phase: Install a new start capacitor, run capacitor, and start relay.\n3 phase: Install a new magnetic contactor.\nThermostatic \nExpansion Valves\n• Attach the thermostatic expansion valve bulb to the suction line in the same location as \nthe previous bulb. \n• The bulb should be between the 10 and 2 o'clock positions on the tube. \n• Secure the bulb with the clamp and holder, then insulate it.\nHot Gas Valves\nLiquid Line \nValves\n• Replace the strainer if applicable.\n• Use copper tube of the same diameter and length when replacing valve lines.\nFan Motors\nInstall a new capacitor.\nPump Motor\nInstall a new capacitor.\nThermistor\n• Attach the new thermistor to the suction line in the same location as the previous \nthermistor. \n• The thermistor should be at the 12 o'clock position on the tube.\n• Smoothly fill the recessed area of the thermistor holder with high thermal conductive \ntype sealant. Hoshizaki America part number 4A0683-01 (Silicone Heat Sink Compound \n10-8108 manufactured by GC Electronics), KE-4560 RTV (manufactured by ShinEtsu \nSilicones), or equivalent are recommended. \n• Secure the thermistor with the holder, then insulate it. \n• Be very careful to prevent damage to the leads.\nC. Water Regulating Valve Adjustment (water-cooled model)\nThe water regulating valve is factory set, and generally no adjustment is required. However, \nwhen necessary, adjust the water regulator using the following procedure.\n1) Prepare a thermometer to check the condenser drain temperature. Attach a pressure \ngauge to the high-side line of the system.\n2) 5\n \nmin. after a freeze cycle starts, confirm \nthat the thermometer reads 104°F to 115°F \n(40°C to 46°C). If it does not, rotate the \nadjustment screw by using a flat blade \nscrewdriver until the temperature is in the \nproper range. See Fig. 5. Next, check that \nthe reference pressure is in the range \nindicated in the Head Pressure table in the \nPerformance Data section. If it is not in the \nproper range, verify the refrigerant charge.\n3) Check that the condenser drain temperature is stable.\nFig. 5\nAdjustment Screw\nCW – Higher\nCCW – Lower\nTop View\n55\nV.
